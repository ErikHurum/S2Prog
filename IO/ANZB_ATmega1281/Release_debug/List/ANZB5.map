Error[e16]: Segment INTVEC (size: 0x9c align: 0x1) is too long for segment definition. At least 0x10 more bytes needed. The problem occurred while processing the segment placement command "-Z(CODE)INTVEC=0-(_..X_INTVEC_SIZE-1)", where at the moment of placement the available memory ranges were "CODE:0-8b"
   Reserved ranges relevant to this placement:
   CODE:0-8b            ?FILL1
