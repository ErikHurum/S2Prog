in 2.6.12.0
•	Modbus support is expanded to enable Viscosity, Ambient Temperature, Seawater Temperature, Cargo Type Name and Cargo Color (These things can now also be used in PVCS II)
•	Added alarm limits for Inerted tank condition 
o	HighIGPress, LowIGPress, with corresponding AlarmTypes keywords: HighInertGasPress and LowInertGasPress 
o	Added HIHILInePress Alarm limit
•	Added LowLowLevelLimit alarm limit (intended for engine room tanks) with corresponding AlarmType keyword LOLOLevel. Also added LowLowLevelLocked keyword
•	More TCU statistics are sent to ANWin for easier debugging (Erik might be asking for this if you have trouble). This is found under Hardware – TCU.
•	Some ANWin menus have been reorganized; Modbus protocol view is now located under View - Protocol
•	The passcode 65535 now silences the alarms for 8 hours (Intended for production and commissioning work) – please do not spread this passcode
•	Cargo Viscosity added to Cargo Info and to Units library
•	Extended error-checking of config upon boot. More double ID's and issues regarding ID reported now. Some ID conflicts are resolved automatically, but will still result in Yellow Page
•	ANWIN Drafts window now has color legend. The fields for the various draft values are now color coded if not properly online or if calculated values are used.
•	Lookup function in Group window in ANWIN: you can enter any value in the VOL%, Ullage or Vol columns to look up corresponding values. EG you want to see what ullage corresponds to a certain volume or how much volume you have at 35% VOL%. Alternatively, you can perform the same type lookup from Tank Details – Alarm Tab. 
•	AWNIn will now tell what line numbers hold duplicate ID pairs (Yellow pages)
•	Built in ID number range check for various tank types
•	Selectable Vol% bargraph or plain number in group windows in ANWIN
•	Tank Details window now have more alarm limits, can calculate alarm limits (e.g. input a requested volume to find corresponding VOL%) Results tab have selctable values (right-click any label) 

Bug Fixes:
•	Tank Bargraphs now displays normally
•	Fonts in the various Group windows are now a real 10pt by default. 
•	Custom Colors in Cargo Type window has been fixed. Default custom colors added.
•	An issue that gave Yellow Pages for ID's on external digital inputs for display only have been fixed
•	Occurrence of Yellow pages on TDU will now allow program to continue to run, however it may severely affect program performance. This should allow TDU to automatically be updated after Yellow Page
•	Some stack sizes have been adjusted to accommodate heavy traffic for larger systems
•	Communication timeout delays have been adjusted to avoid communication faults
•	ANWIN now remembers what printer you have selected
•	General bugfixing of grid behavior in ANWin
•	Some data that were missing from MODBUS monitor now displays correctly.
•	Line number reference on yellow pages is now a lot more accurate – listing the correct line and not the following one or ones.
